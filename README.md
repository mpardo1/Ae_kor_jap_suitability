# Code to Compute Aedes koreicus and Aedes japonicus Suitability via the Mosquito Reproduction Number

This repository contains the code used to reproduce the analysis presented in the paper:

“Environmental Suitability of Aedes japonicus and Aedes koreicus in Europe: A Hybrid Modeling Approach Using Multi-Source Data.”

The code is organized in numbered scripts that should be executed sequentially to reproduce the full analysis pipeline:
